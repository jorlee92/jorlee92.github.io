One ongoing issue that I have run into while trying to learn programming, especially specific topics, is the sheer number of options we have these days to do that. You can learn at school, in specialized training or boot camps, or from a seemingly endless. Over the years I started learning from books, then took in-person computer science courses, then used online resources like Udacity and FreeCodeCamp, went back to school, spent more time self-studying, and mostly just kept hopping around. 

Some part of it is likely my relative lack of context, which I hope has improved over time, but honestly, I am still mostly figuring it out as I go. People spend endless amounts of time arguing the merits of different technologies and tools, and all too often consider some to be terrible, even having elitist attitudes towards those who use those tools, which obviously causes relative outsiders (like myself) shy away from those languages and tools, often times after investing a bit of time into trying to learn about it. 

There are also the massive number of sites and resources you can use, many of which cover wildly different material. One guide I was using a while back was the "Job Ready" guide by [P1xt](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides), which is based somewhat on the [Open Source Society Guide](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) but different enough that that causes its own hard choice. But that only came after trying FreeCodeCamp (I found the link on their forums), which I was led to around the time I was trying sites like Udacity and EdX primarily (Back when I wanted to make Android apps).

Honestly, the question of **How** to best learn to program often gets obsessed over to the point that it is massively counter-productive. The most important thing to do (*in my opinion*) is just to actually start coding, and figure the rest of it out as you go. I can't imagine how much better I would be right now if I hadn't spent so much time wondering if it should be Python or Java, if I should be doing web development or Android, if it should be 600.1x or CS50, etc. My new opinion is to just start doing **Something** and not to waste massive amounts of time obsessing over being sure you are doing it right, if it turns out that you are you can always make a change later, and its not like there is a downside to learning something new, or even twice.

Because of this I have decided to focus on a handful of resources I thought looked good, while finishing school (and obviously working), and if I decide against to change my mind partially through a resource at least I learned some new things (Like more about algorithms from MIT's 6.00.2x, more about how computers work from Nand2Tetris, and that Racket is a language from "How to Code: Simple Data"). Right now I am spending ~1-2 hours a day on courses from the Open Source Society list, but more importantly, I am actually sticking to something (As long as it doesn't feel like a bad choice, meaning not just switching because something else looked interesting) and following through with it.
