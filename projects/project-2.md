I Built this polling site using React/Express/MongoDB based on the requirements located on [this FreeCodeCamp challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-voting-app/)

You can log in using Oauth2 and your google account, and provided you are logged in you can create new polls. 
Even if you are not logged in you can vote on existing polls.

More details about how I began building this project can be found on [my medium blog](https://medium.com/@jorlee92/recreating-my-freecodecamp-polling-site-part-one-115d0a0473fc)

This is my third re-do of this project, the previous version can be found [Here](https://github.com/jorlee92/fcc-voting-v2), I constanstantly find myself looking at projects like this and realizing that I was doing things in a way I dont like anymore, like using nested promises, or that I wish I had used a different technology, like react, so I re-do the project.
