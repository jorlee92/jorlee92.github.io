summary: My Udacity "Mobile Web Specialist" Nanodegree
---

In 2018 I completed a Udacity nano-degree sponsored by Google as part of their ["Grow with Google" Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google)

Throughout this course I learned a lot about modern JavaScript, and completed several projects aimed at showcasing those newly learned skills. The projects for this course were all working towards building on online menu that was responsive, accessible, and met performance and best practice requirements. Throughout this course I was introduced to several new technologies that I likely would not have learned about at that point in time without this course, including Service Workers, IndexedDB, and many new ES6 features. 

The 3 different projects were:
 - (1) Given some base CSS/HTML for an online Menu, fix it so that it meets the accessibility and responsiveness requirements, and that it renders properly offline.
 - (2) Given the code from the previous project change it so that it caches the JSON that it pulls from the API in IndexedDB and allows them to be available offline. This also had a requirement that it pass the Lighthouse testing in Chrome [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
 - (3) Part 3 involved improving offline functionality, beyond just allowing the user to view cached data when offline I needed to allow them to interact with the site (For example favoriting a resturaunt, or adding a review) and store that data until they are back online, and upload that data when they come back online.

Beyond what I needed to figure out for my projects I learned a lot about ES6 features, and honestly the videos in each lesson were great and explained the concepts well, especially given the exersises. There was also a Slack community that could be relied on to answer questions that I had, which I also appreciated.
